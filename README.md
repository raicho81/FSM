# Pharo-FSM
Pharo / Smalltalk FSM implementation.
Finally Hooray I've made it - an almost complete Smalltalk Project :P
Smalltalk programming may be a little bit confusing and overhelming for all of us coming from a traditional declarative types of programming languages and environments.  The keyword here is productivity. I think that Smalltalk can make you much more productive than any other mainstream language. I am not talking about program performance although the PharoVM is pretty fast and optimised as it is created by some of the masterminds in the field anyway, but human performance. Getting things done faster, easier and with less bugs. Debugging segfaults and other memory/OS/compilers/libriaries and etc. related stuff can really turn off even the most motivated hardcore hacker or wanna be. Smalltalk takes out this complexity and lets you focus on what is more important.
