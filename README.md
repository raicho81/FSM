# Pharo-FSM
Simple Pharo / Smalltalk FSM implementation with an extensive Test Suite.
Getting things done faster, easier and with less bugs and stress lowers the cognitive load of writing programs. Constantly debugging segfaults and other memory/OS/compilers/libriaries/networking/IPC/UI/GPU/Audio/Crypto/(Net)FileSystems and etc. related stuff can really turn off even the most motivated hardcore hacker at one point. Smalltalk takes out this complexity and lets us focus on what is more important. The live environmemnt of Smalltalk/Pharo is really immersive. No more compilation or whatsoever you can model/debug/inspect your program and objects Live right on The VM in almost realtime and see the changes you made in the code immediately as methods and classes are recompiled and replaced immediatly using the Pharo Opal Compiler. You are free to modify even the Core libraries interactively and the sorce code is there and you can read it/modify it at any point in time.
