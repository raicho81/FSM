# Pharo-FSM
Simple Pharo / Smalltalk FSM implementation with an extensive Test Suite.
Finally Hooray I've made it - an almost complete Smalltalk Project :P If I must be honest it took me some serious efforts to bend my mind towards this paradigm in programming. Smalltalk programming may be a little bit confusing and overhelming for all of us coming from a traditional declarative types of programming languages and environments. The keyword here is productivity. I am not talking about program performance although the PharoVM is pretty fast and optimised as it is created by some of the masterminds in the field anyway (http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr/), but human performance. Getting things done faster, easier and with less bugs and stress. Debugging segfaults and other memory/OS/compilers/libriaries/networking/UI/GPU/Audio/Crypto/(Net)FileSystems and etc. related stuff can really turn off even the most motivated hardcore hacker at one point. Smalltalk takes out this complexity and lets you focus on what is more important. The live environmemnt of Smalltalk/Pharo is really immersive. No more compilation or whatsoever you can model/debug/inspect your program and objects Live right on The VM in almost realtime and see the changes you made in the code immediately. You are free to modify even the Core libraries interactively and the sorce code is there and you can read it/modify it. Nice huh :)
